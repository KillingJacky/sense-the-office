The properties includes readable properties and writable properties.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### 2. How to get the resource description of the offfice\r\nThe office broadcasts its resources via a MQTT topic \"seeed-office-2016/well-known\" at MQTT broker test.mosquitto.org. You can use any MQTT client in any language. Take mosquitto_sub as an example:\r\n\r\n`mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -t seeed-office-2016/well-known`\r\n\r\nThen you will get messages printing like:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsub topic: seeed-office-2016/events payload: door-income\r\n```\r\n\r\n(might use websocket to expose the property of the office onto a local network in the future)\r\n\r\nThe sensor or actuator will broadcast its resource endpoints every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n### 3.
